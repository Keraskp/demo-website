    <h1>Tech News</h1>
    <p>Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or, as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment.</p>

            <h3>Electric Vehicle</h3>
            <p>An EV is defined as a vehicle that can be powered by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery and is capable of being charged from an external source.</p>

            <p>Amazon India on Thursday announced its first-ever floating store on Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir, as part of its last-mile delivery programme “I Have Space”. Murtaza Khan Kashi, owner of houseboat Selec Town, will deliver packages every day to customers at the doorstep of their houseboats as part of the onboarding.</p>

            <h3>Bluetooth Speaker</h3>
            <p>This little Bluetooth speaker is ideal for those who want to listen to some tunes in the shower. It’s fully waterproof, cheap, and comes in three different colours. You can even pair two together for stereo sound.

                Better yet, at 50 per cent volume, the Ikea Vappeby shower speaker promises up to 80 hours of battery life on a full charge.
                
                It is worth noting that the IP67 waterproofing is only so good, soaking the speaker can affect acoustic performance temporarily, but this is one of the best cheap portable speaker that works in the shower.</p>

                This pocket-sized powerhouse is light, weighing just 211g, and is capable of filming in a wide-angle 19mm format in 4K UHD CMOS (55 minutes of shooting time).

            <h3>Philips Signe Floor Lamp</h3>
            <p>If you’re on the lookout for a new light fixture, the Philips Signe floor lamp could just be the one you’ve been searching for. Owing to its minimal design and use of fully controllable gradient lighting, the Signe gradient floor lamp is a cool bit of kit.

                By using the Hue app, voice commands, or smart accessories. you can control the gradient lamp and tell it which colours to use along its line of lights. You can blend colours for natural looks, go for something moody and dramatic, and even set dynamic scenes that move slowly through a light cycle to create whatever effect you’d like.</p>

            <h3>Beeline Velo 2</h3>
            <p>Trying to get around a city on a bike is a stress like no other, attempting to navigate cars, people and lanes while also tracking your destination on your phone with a confused navigation system. The Velo 2 cycling computer is unfortunately unable to remove the cars and people in your way, but it can make the navigation easier.

                This tiny circular device attaches to your bike, giving you easy minimal navigation instructions that are built from tracking real life journeys. You can also track your speed, arrival time, distance and check the time. It’s even weatherproof.</p>

            <h3>Sonos Era 300</h3>
            <p>You've heard of wireless Bluetooth speakers but how about an all-in-one surround sound system in one? The Sonos Era 300 speaker has Dolby Atmos capability with six class-D digital amplifiers and promises a rich sound with four tweeters and two woofers all in one speaker.

                Working over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and auxiliary inputs with the Sonos Line-In Adapter to connect traditional devices such as vinyl turntables, CD players, and TVs, the Era 300 speaker is a great bit of tech for those who love streaming music and watching films in a simple to understand way without missing out on quality.</p>

            <h3>Amazon Kindle Scribe</h3>
            <p>Amazon has come a long way since its first Kindle device, but a feature that they have been slow to take up is the stylus. Now, with the Kindle Scribe, you can scribble notes on the book you are reading, make handwritten notes, and generally get more out of your Kindle.

                The device also features one of Kindle's best displays, meaning you can continue to read in bright lighting. There is also a warm light setting for when you want to wind down and get ready for bed.</p>

            <h3> DJI Mini 3 Pro</h3>
            <p>Every year, DJI's Mini series gets smaller and yet more powerful, cramming high-end specs into a lightweight drone that you can chuck in your bag.

                But with all those improvements, comes an eye- watering price, and an increasing fear for your financial status if you crash it. It offers advanced obstacle avoidance features, a rotating lens so you can film portrait or landscape, 4K video, smart flying features like automatic tracking and the ability to follow a subject.
                
                Despite its higher price, this feels like the perfect drone for beginners, those who like to travel, or really anyone in the market for a light- weight, high tech drone.</p>

            <h3>iRobot Roomba J7+</h3>
            <p>iRobot, not to be confused with the 2004 Will Smith classic, is the leading creator of robot vacuums with the Roomba range. Getting smarter each year, the new Roomba J7+ combines both vacuum and mop in one machine. This itself isn't new, but the company has introduced a new self-retracting mop feature.

                The mop lifts out of the way when it approaches carpet, only using the mop in the places you want it. In theory, this means a robot vacuum that can be fully independent and doesn't need to be assisted... so this is how the robot uprising starts.</p>
